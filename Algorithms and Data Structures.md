Algorithms is a sequence of instructions or commands carried out systematically in order to solve a problem or perform a certain task. There is communs algorithms that are used in, i will cover the most communs ones, but everything can turn into a algorithms, you just need to abstract it.
Data structures are a storage that is used to store and organize data.

## Euclid's algorithm
Used to find the greatest common diviser of two positive intergers.
Consider two positive integers "m" and "n", such that, m > n.

	Step 1: Divide m by n, and let the remainder be r.
	Step 2: If r=0, the algorithm ends, n is the GCD.
	Step 3: Set, m=n, n=r, go back to step 1 and continue till r=0.

## Bubble sort algorithm
Used to sort a array.
