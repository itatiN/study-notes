# Api
	It is what the intermediary between client and server does. Routines and patterns established by the API, so that other applications can use the functionalities of this API.

# Rest
	Set of rules for transferring data between client and server.

# RestFul
There are 5 needs for an application to be considered RestFul.

	Separate client-server
	
	Stateless: each request will need to have all the information for the server to understand and respond
	
	Cacheable: Responses to a request should be explicit in saying whether or not they can be cached by the client
	
	Layered System: Client accesses an endpoint without needing to know the complexity of the server.
	
	Code on demand: Gives the possibility for the application to pick up codes, such as JS, for example, and run them on the client.
