Is used to get the time complexity of a algorithm.

## O(1)
	Time complexity that are always the same idenpent of how much objets are in the algorithm.
	Examples: pop and push from a array.

## 0(logN)
	In each iteration of a loop, we eliminates half of the elements of the same one.
	Examples: Binary Search | Pop and Push from a Heap.

## O(N)
	Linear time complexity, the more objects have in a input the more time for execute is.
	Examples: For loop doing something in a Array.

## O(Nlog)
	Examples: Sort | Merge Sort | Heap sort.

## O(NÂ²)
	Linear over linear, basicaly a code that need a iteration over a iteration.
	Example: For loop in a for loop.

## O(2N)
	Exemple: Recursion

## O(N!)
	The worst possibile time complexity, but sometimes is the only way that can solve a problem.
	You rarely see it and is more found in Permutation or Graphs Problems.
