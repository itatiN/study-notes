## Docker Desktop vs Docker Engine
Docker desktop offers a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for you to use it. If you are new to Docker and want to test it or learn it, this is the easy way.
Docker Engine is a CLI (Comand Line Interface) that u type the comands needed to run and build your containers, if you wanna the best perfomace, this is the way.

## Perfomace
Docker is native on linux, on windows the same is not true. To use it on the best perfomace you should run it native on linux or use the WSL2 on windows. If you preffer the WSL2 path, use the linux filesystem that builds into your windows, and be sure to use docker engine and stop docker desktop in your aplication.
