If you dont know what is Object Oriented Programming, check in the [Programming Paradigms]().

## Abstraction
It consists of having a notion of what the object will accomplish in the application.
There are three points that must be taken into account in the abstraction.

	The first point is to give an identity to the object that we are going to create. This identity must be unique within the system so that there is no conflict.
	The second part concerns the characteristics of the object. These characteristics are called properties.
	  The third part is to define the actions that the object will perform. These actions, or events, are called methods.

## Encapsulation
	It is one of the elements that add security to the application in OOP by hiding the properties.
	Many languages put private properties, getters and setters, responsible for returning and setting the value of the property.

## Inheritance
	Inheritance makes it possible for classes to share their attributes, methods, and other class members with each other. For the link between classes, inheritance adopts a hierarchically schematized relationship.

## Polymorphism
	It's the unique feature of object-oriented languages that allows different objects to respond to the same message each in its own way. 
	Consists of changing the inner workings of a method inherited from a parent object.
