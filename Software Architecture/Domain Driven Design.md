DDD appreciates that developers are part of the process of understanding the business and all its models from the most diverse angles instead of simply interviewing experts.

## Domain
Domain is the heart of the business you are working on. It is based on a set of ideals, knowledge and business processes.

## Pillars of DDD
	Ubiquitous Language:
	  Definition of words that will be used on a daily basis in the context of the company.
	
	Bounded Contexts:
	  Delimits the context of the application.
	  Each context has its clearly defined responsibilities.
	  Each context can have its own ubiquitous language.
	  Use of stories and survey of the scope of the project with the domain expert to help in the context delimitation process.
	
	Context Maps: It's a map to link your application's contexts.

## Strategic modeling
Where you define your system contexts.

	Main Domains is the fundamental part of your system.
	Domain Generico is something that works by itself, but that complements your system.
	Auxiliary Domain is the entry part to your system.
